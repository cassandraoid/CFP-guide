# CFP-guide
A quick outline on how to build a CFP that can be refined and reused for conference submissions. 

### Talk title:
Varies on conference, some are ‘fun’ some are ‘serious’
Opt to have 2 or 3 options here to choose from, you can build from there. 

### Short description (~65 characters):
1 sentence on what you’ll go over - you may want to write this 2-3 different ways (like the title) to suit the needs of your auidence. 

### Abstract: 
300 word elevator pitch. This should make someone want to sit down and listen to your talk. You can start by answering the questions in “Long Description” in one sentence each for this abstract and then expand on them for more detail.

### Long Description:
(First, no you don’t have to answer every single one of these - this is to help you brainstorm 🤔. And… you’re not writing an essay. This is your opportunity to explain why this is a compelling idea for a talk. Don’t make it too long, an expansion for 2–3 paragraphs from your Abstract about should suffice.)

- What will you go over? Detail the procession of what this talk would look like. 
- Where did you get this idea?/ What’s the history behind this talk/ technology?
- Why is this of interest? 
- Why are you proposing this solution?
-  What problem are you fixing?
- What will the audience learn/ takeaway?
  - If you’re writing for a specific conference mention it here.
- …take a step back. Think about what questions an audience may ask you. How can you incorporate those answers here? (this applies to when you’re building your presentation 😃 )

### Keywords/ Tags:

- Buzzwords
- Key technologies used in the talk

### Audience Level:

- Beginner
- Intermediate
- Advanced

### Type of Talk:

- Tutorial
- Lecture
- Lightning talk 
- etc….
